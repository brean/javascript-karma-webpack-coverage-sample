# JavaScript + karma + WebPack + Istanbul
Basic example of ECMAScript 6 using Webpack, Karma and Istanbul (automatic unit testing with coverage report)

## Motivation
I did not find an example project that was using webpack and provided test coverage for JavaScript.

## Acknowledgments
Based on the [typescript-karma-webpack-coverage-sample](https://github.com/mcliment/typescript-karma-webpack-coverage-sample)
by [mcliment](https://github.com/mcliment) but for ES 6.

I switched to the Chromium launcher/pupeteer because PhantomJS does not support ES6.
